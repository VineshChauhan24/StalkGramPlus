#StalkGram Plus

This is an app to download videos and images from **Instagram.**

The project contains an exemplification of the Model-View-Presenter pattern used together with Clean Architecture.

## Use case 
Just copy the link of an image in the app, and press the *FloatingActionButton* of the app. 

A progress bar is going to show you how long it takes to download the file. Once the file was downloaded, you can
share it or set as profile picture.
